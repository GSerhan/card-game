# card-game
A simple card game. Given one Shuffled Deck of Cards and two Players. Each turn each player takes 1 top card from the deck. After comparison of the values the cards are going to  the player that has a higher card. (ex. 10 is higher than 8, King is higher than 10) When both of the cards have the same value (ex. two aces) they should go back to deck and deck will be reshuffled. Once the deck is empty, the game ends. The player who has more cards - wins.
